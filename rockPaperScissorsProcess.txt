OBJECTIVE:
This program will allow the user to play Rock Paper Scissors against the computer. 
- We will create code that checks who won each round
- We will create code that takes input(choices) from the user
- We will create code that takes 'input'(choices) from the computer
- We will create code that checks if the user wants to  quit, or if the user doesn't enter one of the options(rock, paper, or scissors)
- We will loop each round of the game
- We will add statements at the end and the beginning that welcome and thank the user for playing. 
- We will loop the whole game, so that the user can keep playing until they choose to quite

PSEUDOCODE: 

#set variable keepPlaying to true
#while keepPlaying is true:

    #print statement welcoming players to game
    #print statement stating the rules (best 2 out of 3 Press 'q' to  quit)
    
    #make a key that assigns a number to each choice for the computer
    #(rock is 1, scissors is 2, paper is 3)
    
    #import the random function
    
    #set computer's score to 0
    #set player's score to 0
    
    #while player's score is less than 2 and computer's score is less than 2:
    
        #computer's choice = random number between 1 and 3
        #player's choices = input(ask player to select Rock, Paper, or Scissors)
        
        #if player inputs 'q' or 'Q':
            # set keepPlaying to False
            #stop the loop
            
            #else if (player inputs rock and computer chooses rock) or
            #(player inputs paper and computer chooses paper) or
            #(player inputs scissors andn computer chooses scissors):
                #print out DRAW
                #print out player's score and computer's score

            #(player inputs scissors and computer chooses paper) or
            #(player inputs paper and computer chooses rock):
                #add one to the player's score
                #print out player's score and computer's score
                
            #else if (player inputs rock and computer chooses paper) or

                #print out player's score and computer's score
                
            #else:
                #tell the user their input was not valid

#print statement thanking the players for playing
#if player's score is 2:
    #print statement letting the player know they won
#if computer's score is 2:
    #print statement letting the player know the computer won
#print out player's score and computer's score
